## Technologies

- [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) is a build tool that offers an ultra-fast development experience. It leverages the native ES module system, providing instant server startup and hot module replacement (HMR). Speed up your workflow and streamline your development process with ViteJS.

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) provides strong typing and better code quality, reducing errors and enhancing maintainability as your project grows.

- [Eslint](https://eslint.org) enforces coding standards and identifies potential issues, ensuring code consistency and improving overall code quality.

- [Airbnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) provides a widely recognized and well-documented set of coding conventions, enhancing code readability, maintainability, and collaboration with other developers, while also aligning your project with industry best practices.

- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/) automatically formats code, saving time and ensuring a consistent code style throughout the project, which is crucial for collaboration and readability.
